# ToDo Backend

This is an example of a backend REST API application with use of Express and MongoDB. I wrote it as a backend to my ToDo learning projects.

## Get started

*Notice - this app could use a **Frontend App**. Select one from list below.*

Install dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start
